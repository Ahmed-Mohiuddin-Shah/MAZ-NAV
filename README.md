# MAZ-NAV

Welcome to the MAZ-NAV repository! This project aims to create an intelligent robot capable of autonomously detecting and solving mazes using computer vision technology powered by OpenCV.

## Functionality

The project integrates OpenCV-based image processing to interpret maze layouts and navigate autonomously. Key components include:
- **OpenCV Flutter App**: Detects maze patterns and facilitates autonomous navigation.
- **ESP32 Code**: Controls the rover's movements based on visual data received from the app.
- **3D Models**: Physical components for constructing the robot.
- **Circuit Diagrams**: Guides for assembling the hardware.

## Project Structure

- **3D-models**: Contains 3D models for the robot components.
- **circuit-diagram**: Includes circuit diagrams for electronics.
- **bom**: Includes the Bill Of Materials in an Excel sheet
- **maz_nav**: Flutter-based OpenCV app for maze detection and solving.
- **maz-nav-rover**: ESP32-based rover PlatformIO project.
- **MAZ-NAV-WORKSPACE.code-workspace**: Visual Studio Code workspace configuration.
